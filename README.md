<h1 align="center">Welcome üëã, EduCA - GDSC Solution Challenge 2022</h1>
<h3 align="center">One of the main weaknesses of our country is education, this problem intensified with the COVID - 19, schools closed and many students, unfortunately, were deprived of receiving education.Our solution has the essential characteristics of education embodied in the Peruvian National Curriculum, an education guide proposed by the Peruvian Ministry of Education. EduCA-App proposes an interactive journey in an application developed in Flutter that guides the student through a learning path in which he can choose the area to develop, the competence he wants to reinforce and the skills to apply.</h3>

- üìù Objectives **1.Our next step is to establish a strategic alliance with the Local Educational Management Unit (UGEL-PALPA) to implement our app as a pilot project that contributes to student learning in order to support in the process of developing learning sessions. 2.Our main objective is to install EduCA in as many tablets as possible, which were provided by the Peruvian government, however, these devices are not being used correctly.**
